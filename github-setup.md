# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Repository Information
- **Name**: AI-Organization-Development-Template
- **Description**: AI Organization Development Template - A framework for creating AI-powered organizational structures with multiple agents

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Open your web browser and go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the following information:
   - **Repository name**: `AI-Organization-Development-Template`
   - **Description**: `AI Organization Development Template - A framework for creating AI-powered organizational structures with multiple agents`
   - **Public/Private**: Choose "Public" (or "Private" if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have files)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Organization-Development-Template.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Organization-Development-Template.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page to see all your files uploaded.

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can run this single command from your project directory:

```bash
gh repo create AI-Organization-Development-Template --public --source=. --remote=origin --push --description "AI Organization Development Template - A framework for creating AI-powered organizational structures with multiple agents"
```

## Your Current Git Status

Your local repository is ready with:
- All files staged and committed
- Latest commit: "Initial commit: AI Organization Development Template"
- Current branch: main

Just follow the steps above to push to GitHub!
